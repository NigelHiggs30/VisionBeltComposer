#```VisionBeltComposer``` is an intuitive tool crafted for overlaying objects onto conveyor belt scenes with precision and ease. Harnessed with the power of OpenCV, it facilitates the merging of a base conveyor belt image with a separate image of an object. Users provide file paths to the two images and pinpoint the desired location for the object within the scene. An advanced bounding box feature is at hand for meticulous placement, honing in on specific image regions, especially useful when the object is set against a predominantly black background. Alternatively, users can opt for a straightforward placement without adjustments. VisionBeltComposer streamlines the process to efficiently produce and save the composited result.
